# Silly Little App PROX
[SLA](https://github.com/dswan36/acprox) Is a PROX website using Ultraviolet. 

It's easy to setup and can be done with less work and is easier to use than a full Private Network, but will have more overhead.

First Clone it with [this link](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/dswan36/acprox) to your Vercel account!

Vercel will help you make a new repo and deploy it..... and that should be it.

After that you can also setup any custom domains in Settings > Domains

::alert{type="warning"}
Note that some links may break in this app if you are not hosting on a custom domain (the links to the status page and main website on the homepage), as this guide expects you to. However, as is the nature with any open source project, you can simply edit it.
