# Silly Little App PROX
[SLA](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/acprox) Is a PROX website using Ultraviolet. 
It's easy to setup and can be done with less work and is easier to use than a full Private Network, but will have more overhead.
First Clone it with [this link](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/acprox) to your Vercel account!
Vercel will help you make a new repo and deploy it..... and that should be it.
After that you can also setup any custom domains in Settings > Domains
