ðŸ“’ This requires you to be able to install Private Networks on a Chromebook, most documentation cannot be translated to other OSs. If you are looking for the PROX tool check it out [here](/setup/acprox).

Silly Little Files (not to be confused with the project name) is the documentation for importing files made from **Proton** into **Chromebooks**
If you have gotten Github Pro this will be easier to setup with Firebase.

Once you have made your Firebase Project, make a new Github repo for the project.
Make your repo by forking [SLF](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/SillyLittleFiles/tree/main)
Click the

Code

button on the repo's main page.
Click `Codespaces` and then `Create codespace on main`
Once in there you can run
  ::terminal
  ---
  content:
  - npm install -g firebase-tools
  - firebase login --no-localhost
  - firebase init
  ---

  ::alert{type="danger"}
If you get prompted to setup Github Actions here **don't** this will be broken since you are in a codespace! We'll do this manually.

Once you have that done, go ahead and run `firebase deploy` and see the result webpage.

Note, you can setup custom domains in your project settings, or skip the custom domain step altogether

Check out the [Production](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/SillyLittleFiles/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml) & [Preview](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/SillyLittleFiles/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml) files in [SLF](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/SillyLittleFiles/tree/main) to use as an example for setting up your actions.
Make sure to edit the `projectId` value!
You will also need to add a repository secret in your settings with your service account ID. You can read about getting that [here](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy/blob/main/docs/service-account.md)

After all this, each time you push or modify something in the repo, it should update in the deployment.

If this is too hard, you can also use another static site hosting provider :D
