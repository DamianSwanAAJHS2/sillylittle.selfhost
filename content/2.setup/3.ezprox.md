::alert{type="info"}
ℹ️ | This documentation is for setting up https://prox.sillylittle.tech on your own domain/setup, visit the URL for the publically hosted version, and append your URL to use it (eg. https://prox.sillylittle.tech/https://www.example.com)
::

It's easy to setup and can be done with less work and is easier to use than a full Private Network or ACPROX but could be more vunderable to exposed data in network traffic.

First Clone it with [this link](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/dswan36/ezprox) to your Vercel account!

Vercel will help you make a new repo and deploy it..... and that should be it.

Now, simply enter a URL after your domain (ex. example.com/https://google.com) and you should be able to access the web.

::alert{type="warning"}
PLEASE NOTE: While it is possible to have just `/` be your prefix, it tends to cause instability in the bare relay. This seems to occur even if you host the bare note externally. \
Because of this, it is recommended to use something else as your prefix such as `/u/` in my example. 
::

After that you can also setup any custom domains in Settings > Domains

::alert{type="danger"}
Despite EZPROX being simpler than other methods due to its unencoded URLs sites used could be exposed via network traffic to either your ISP or Company Network, be advised.
