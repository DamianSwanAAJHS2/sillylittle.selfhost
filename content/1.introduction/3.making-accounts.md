# Making Accounts Needed
The first thing you would probally need is a [Github](https://github.com) account, so you can store the code!

::alert{type="warning"}
ðŸ¤” Some account's will have Firebase disabled, usually account's marked as under 18 (but you never know, or you could use another account)

Other than that (if you can) make a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) project.

Also make an account @ [Vercel](https://vercel.app) which you can make using your previously made [Github](https://github.com) account.
