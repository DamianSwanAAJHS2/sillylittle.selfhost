# Tools We'll be using
For these projects there are two main tools (excluding Github) used
## Firebase!
1. Because it's free with a Google Account (and some accounts still let you access it)
2. Because it's easy to set up static web hosting, (why it's used on [SLF](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/SillyLittleFiles)).

It does however have an annoying setup on Gihub IMHO, because you have to make a .yaml action and setup some funkey Google Cloud IAMs. 
But any static web hoster should be able to host [SLF](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/SillyLittleFiles) Fine.

## Vercel

Oh how I love Vercel.
A free Static and Semi-dynamic hosting platform that can get some basic sites (with some more complex tools) running. 
It's how [SLA](https://github.com/DamianSwanAAJHS2/acprox) Works!
